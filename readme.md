# Installation

Running install.php from the root should install everything necessary, dynamically but there is an sql file also incase that fails for any reason.

The path for the voting interface is: `/kineo/vote`

## Functionality
I have spent around 6 hours working on this application but I have run out of time to complete it in the way that I wanted to, in regards to showing the results in the graphs. The graphs currently only show a simple count of the results.

I also wanted to use the Symfony query builder but I was having some trouble in getting it to function so I thought it was best in this case to go with what is working.
